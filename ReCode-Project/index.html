                <p class="assay">My amazing journey in web development started with RECODE. in November 2018 I was one of those lucky enough to attend their weekend workshop, this ignited a spark in me and I became eager to
                        continue this new path that I became fond of.

                <p class="assay">RECODE team was inspiring and focused on helping us the refugees in Malaysia to see the new opportunities available
                        as web developers. As this was my introduction to the web development world, I didn't want to stop and seeked online courses to learn more and during those few months RECODE team kept 
                    in touch and their guidance and help was simply amazing.

                <p class="assay">While this website serves the purpose of an application to the Bootcamp provided by RECODE, this page is to show myself how much I learned and a reminder 
                    to my future-self how much I was missing still.

                            <p class="paragraph"> I've developed a passion for technology and computers since in my teens however I didn't get the chance to study programming until recently. and while I was able to
                            learn a little online about Python, I was missing the mentorship and guidance. also as a beginner I felt lost in this new world. now with RECODE Bootcamp in  
                            sight I feel the ambition and the will not only to learn web development as a side hobby but as a career choice. the feeling of accomplishment 
                            is extraordinary, finding solutions to problems and watching your code runnign smoothly is something I got addicted to.
